# Just a list of character ideas
# Will have to put them in a list and such
# So it'd be great to have my friends as playable characters
# The basics of a character should be their visuals - 
# - and abilities (Ultimate Ability included)

# Concept
# WASD to move character/give direction when aiming
# Basic attack, Special attack, Ultimate (similar to smash bros, brawl)
# 'J' for basic, 'K' for special, both for ultimate
# Ultimate needs to charge up to be used
# Charges from dealing damage or sustaining damage
# Spacebar should be used to jump instead of 'W'
# Personal Aspects should be implemented for diff character
# Example: (Height, weight, primary emotion)

# NOTE: Coding different characters will take a while
