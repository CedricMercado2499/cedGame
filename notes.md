# So yeah, this is a game I plan on creating
# My initial idea was to make a fighting game -
# with a bunch of different characters with - 
# different abilities.
# It'd be cool to make some of those different - 
# characters my friends, it'd be funny.
# I guess in a way, I'm trying to recreate -
# Smash Bros. Brawl, but with my own characters.

# My first step is to make a movable object
# Stuff like a skip-able intro screen would be good
# A character selection
# A training dummy that measures how much damage you deal

# I'm still learning how to use PyGame, and I don't have - 
# any experience in making games, but this would be -
# a great challenge.

# I created a movable square..
# The goal now is to add borders and physics
# The square shouldn't go out of bounds

# March 10, 2023
# Borders are implemented, next is to include gravity
# Quick and simple gravity
# Not sure if I want to include character selection
# I guess I should include attacks or projectiles
# Intro screen -> Character Selection -> Play
# Now that gravity has been implemented
# The goal now is to make the character face left/right

# March 13, 2023
# One of the goals is to make the character face left/right
# But another goal is to create an intro screen
# I've typed up some code that should display the intro
# But it doesn't work properly
# It doesn't load the testimage, and it doesn't stay on for a few seconds
# Had ChatGPT assist me in the intro screen
# ChatGPT is quite reliable, I feel useless using it
# At least I'm getting this done
# I want to implement a 'Start Menu' - includes 'start', 'options', and 'quit'
# Start menu is implemented with the help of ChatGPT...
# I think the next hardest part is the character selection menu
# Well, I think the menu is light work, but when you play different characters, then it's gonna be hard

# March 14, 2023
# Today's goal is a character selection screen
# It should include main character selection, a button to return to start menu, and a start game button
# I created a character selection screen, I just need to make it look better
# The character selection screen is functional
# I can go two ways, map selection or playing the chosen character
# I also have to rename main(), it doesn't feel like a main anymore y'know
