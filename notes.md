# So yeah, this is a game I plan on creating
# My initial idea was to make a fighting game -
# with a bunch of different characters with - 
# different abilities.
# It'd be cool to make some of those different - 
# characters my friends, it'd be funny.
# I guess in a way, I'm trying to recreate -
# Smash Bros. Brawl, but with my own characters.

# My first step is to make a movable object
# Stuff like a skip-able intro screen would be good
# A character selection
# A training dummy that measures how much damage you deal

# I'm still learning how to use PyGame, and I don't have - 
# any experience in making games, but this would be -
# a great challenge.

# I created a movable square..
# The goal now is to add borders and physics
# The square shouldn't go out of bounds

# Borders are implemented, next is to include gravity
# Quick and simple gravity
# Not sure if I want to include character selection
# I guess I should include attacks or projectiles
